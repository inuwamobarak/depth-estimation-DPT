# Image Depth Estimation using Depth Prediction Transformers (DPTs)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Depth Prediction Transformers (DPT), a deep learning model for accurate depth estimation in computer vision tasks. DPT leverages the transformer architecture and an encoder-decoder framework to capture fine-grained details, model long-range dependencies, and generate precise depth predictions.

## Features
- Depth estimation from 2D images using Depth Prediction Transformers.
- Integration of transformer-based encoder and decoder components for accurate depth prediction.
- Implementation of self-attention mechanisms, upsampling, and convolutional layers.
- Support for various computer vision tasks, including autonomous navigation, augmented reality, 3D reconstruction, and robotics.

## Usage
1. Import the necessary modules: `import dpt`
2. Load the pre-trained model: `model = dpt.load_model('path/to/model.weights')`
3. Preprocess the input image: `image = dpt.preprocess_image('path/to/image.jpg')`
4. Perform depth estimation: `depth_map = model.predict(image)`
5. Visualize the depth map or use it for further analysis.
